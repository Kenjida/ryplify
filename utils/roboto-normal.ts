// This file contains the Base64 encoded string for the Roboto-Regular font with latin-ext support.
// It is imported by InvoiceSettingsModal.tsx to embed the font directly into the jsPDF document,
// ensuring that all Czech diacritics are rendered correctly.
// The font data is sourced from the locally installed @fontsource/roboto package.
