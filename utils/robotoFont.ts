// This file contains the Base64 encoded string for the Roboto-Regular font.
// This is done to avoid adding a binary .ttf file to the project directly.
// The font is used by jsPDF to correctly render Czech diacritics in the generated PDF.

export const robotoBase64 = 'AAEAAAARAQAABAAQRFNJRwAAAAAAA... (font data is very long, truncated for brevity)';
// NOTE: The full base64 string is extremely long. A placeholder is used here.
// The actual implementation will contain the full, valid base64 encoded font.
// This is a standard practice for embedding fonts in jsPDF.
// I will replace this placeholder with the actual font data in the next step.
